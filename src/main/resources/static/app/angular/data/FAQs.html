Ultimately we want to offer our customers the widest possible choice of restaurants that they can order their meals from. All of our app customers' experiences are star rated ultimately providing a user curated restaurant listing.</p><p>We'd love to hear from you if your favourite restaurant is missing. Just ping us a message to <a href="mailto:info@mrdfood.com">info@mrdfood.com</a>.</p></li><li id="why-is-a-particular-restaurant-not-available-for-delivery"><h2>Why is a particular restaurant not available for delivery?</h2><p>The new Mr D is all about you and where you are. Each customer gets a personalised list of delivery restaurant options within a limited distance of their location so that we can provide the best service and ensure maximum freshness and deliciousness of your food. Our new <a href="#what-is-this-new-quality-policy" du-smooth-scroll="">Quality Policy</a> limits the restaurants for which delivery is available to within a 5km radius of your location, to make sure we get food from the restaurant to you within 15 minutes.</p></li><li id="why-dont-i-see-any-restaurants-for-delivery-on-the-app"><h2>Why don't I see any restaurants for delivery on the App?</h2><p>In order to provide you with fast delivery times we have limited the distance that food can travel from the restaurant to the customer. The option to deliver will only be available if a restaurant is within a 5km radius from your location. This is in line with our new <a href="#what-is-this-new-quality-policy" du-smooth-scroll="">Quality Policy</a> to make sure we get food from the restaurant to you within 15 minutes.</p><p>Besides, your area may not have been transitioned to the new Mr D Food. Please check out our <a href="faq/#what-areas-do-we-service" du-smooth-scroll="">"What areas do we service section"</a>.</p></li><li id="what-services-does-mr-d-food-offer"><h2>What services does Mr D Food offer?</h2><p>We offer the ability of ordering food for delivery or self-collection. Think of Mr D Food as the go to place for all your takeout needs. With user rated listings you can be sure to find the best your local restaurants, be it a backstreet burger joint or a snazzy steak restaurant, have to offer.</p></li><li id="self-collection-what-is-that-all-about"><h2>Self Collection!? What is that all about?</h2><p>We've realised that convenience means different things to different people so we've introduce the option for self collection. You can select the collection option if you'd like to pick up your order yourself. You'll still be able to track it from confirmation and will receive a pick-up time. So why not give it a try the next time you are going to be passing by your favourite spot - no phone calls, no order errors, convenient advance payment and best of all, skip the queue and just pick up your food ready!</p></li><li id="why-can-i-only-pay-by-credit-card-for-self-collect-orders"><h2>Why can I only pay by credit card for self collect orders?</h2><p>One of the advantages of our new self collect option is that you get to skip the queue and just collect your food - having conveniently already gotten payment out of the way! Cash orders would then lose out on the skip the queue convenience! Another reason for card only collections is that we communicate your order directly to our restaurant partner, request that they start making the food asap and then allow you collect at your leisure. Advance payment of self collect orders allows us to provide our restaurant partners some peace of mind that they can start making the food and that a customer will be on the way because they have already paid.</p></li><li id="why-cant-i-order-by-calling-into-your-call-center-anymore"><h2>Why can't I order by calling into your call center anymore?</h2><p>Over 95% of our customers prefer ordering on the app. In order to focus on making our online and app experiences even better we have decided to focus all our attention and energy on this. Go on over to <a href="/">www.mrdfood.com</a> and give it a try. We are sure you'll enjoy the much faster experience and the lower delivery fees.</p></li><li id="why-cant-i-place-an-order-at-the-branch-anymore"><h2>Why can't I place an order at the branch anymore?</h2><p>The Mr D Branch network, now called Takealot Delivery Team, is focused on becoming a leading logistics provider for deliveries of all sorts. For this reason we have centralised all of Mr D Food's customer interaction to provide you with a consistent as well as focused service experience around all things Food. Refer to the <a href="faq/#what-areas-do-we-service" du-smooth-scroll="">"What areas do we service section"</a> to see which areas have been transitioned.</p></li><li id="what-times-can-i-order-for"><h2>What times can I order for?</h2><p>We deliver every day from 10 am to around 22:00. It depends on the area, the day of the week and of course the relevant restaurant's opening times. Also, we now deliver for breakfast from 7:30, Monday to Friday and from 9:00 on Saturdays in our most central areas. Our breakfast offering will certainly continue to grow so please check back frequently.</p></li><li id="how-is-the-food-delivered-to-me"><h2>How is the food delivered to me?</h2><p>Once you place an order, the restaurant receives your order. They then confirm your order by indicating a food preparation time. From there our driver is dispatched to collect your order and to drop it off directly at your location.</p></li><li id="how-long-does-delivery-take"><h2>How long does delivery take?</h2><p>We deliver to you within 15 minutes from when the food has been collected at the restaurant. Currently our average delivery time is at 34 minutes. Considering usual preparation and driver at restaurant times, you can expect your food within 45 minutes though. During busy times with high driver demand and longer food preparation times, this may take around 1 hour. In essence, we have optimised the last piece of the delivery, when your delicious hot food is in transit.</p></li><li id="can-i-see-where-my-order-currently-is"><h2>Can I see where my order currently is?</h2><p>All orders placed on the app provide you with a detailed view where your order currently is. You'll be notified once the restaurant accepts the order and whether they could stick to their suggested preparation time. You will then be notified once your food has been collected at the restaurant. Lastly, a notification informing you that your driver is nearby will be provided. The driver will press a virtual "doorbell" to notify you on the app that they are outside your door. You'll also receive updates should we have hit an unforeseen bump in the road.</p></li><li id="what-form-of-payments-does-mr-d-food-accept"><h2>What form of payments does Mr D Food accept?</h2><p>It might be 2017, but yes we take Cash on Delivery. For the full cashless experience we would really like you to use your Credit or Cheque card on our mobile apps where you can pay safely and securely. It also provides a safer working environment for our driving waiters. In case orders are rejected we immediately process your refund.</p></li><li id="is-there-a-minimum-order-value"><h2>Is there a minimum order value?</h2><p>Yes, it is typically R65 for delivery orders. There is no minimum order value for Collection orders. Individual restaurants may set their minimum order at a higher value though.</p></li><li id="how-do-i-redeem-a-coupon-code"><h2>How do I redeem a coupon code?</h2><p>Coupon codes can be redeemed on the Mr D Food app and when ordering through <a href="/">www.mrdfood.com</a>. The code is applied on checkout.</p></li><li id="do-you-charge-restaurant-in-store-prices-for-orders-placed-through-mr-d-food"><h2>Do you charge restaurant in-store prices for orders placed through Mr D Food?</h2><p>All restaurants set their own prices on the Mr D Food app. Whilst we encourage our restaurant partners to keep their prices on the app the same as their in-house menu, some restaurants still insist on increasing their prices for delivery. We'll keep doing our best to convince them to maintain a level playing field, but should you have further questions about a restaurant's pricing please contact us on <a href="mailto:info@mrdfood.com">info@mrdfood.com</a> or through the app's Help section.</p></li><li id="can-i-collect-my-order"><h2>Can I collect my order?</h2><p>Yes, you however need to select the "Self Collection" option when placing the order on the app.</p></li><li id="can-i-place-orders-in-advance"><h2>Can I place orders in advance?</h2><p>Not yet, we will let you know once this feature is available.</p></li><li id="how-is-the-food-packaged"><h2>How is the food packaged?</h2><p>The packaging depends on the type of food and restaurant. Packaging is the responsibility of the restaurant. Mr D Food provides best practice guidelines on packaging and we encourage users to rate the packaging. If you have suggestions regarding packaging please contact us on <a href="mailto:info@mrdfood.com">info@mrdfood.com</a>.</p></li></ul></div></section>
